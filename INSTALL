The perl script bin/less-select can just be copied somewhere into your $PATH.
The more difficult problem is to create and install a patched less-program:


A: Generic instructions

Change into a directory containing the (original) less sources and apply
the corresponding patch (with option -p0). If your less sources are
the correct version, no "hunks" should appear.

After a successful patch, you should run the "after-patch" script and
then you can just recompile (and install) the less program.

You will probably also want to install the "less-select" perl script
somewhere in your path and also copy "less-select-key.bin" file to an
appropriate place (use "less-select --man" to see where less-select will
look for this file).

In order to avoid problems with different binaries, you should use
the (patched) lesskey program to regenerate "less-select-key.bin" from its
sources "less-select-key.src".


B: Instructions for SUSE 9.0/9.2 (not up-to-date anymore):

Install the source package for less-382-40 or less-381-88 (or less-381-32;
similar releases might also work, but have not been tested).
Create and copy a less-select.tar.gz containing the following files:
	after-patch
	bin/* (without directory name)
	keys/* (without directory name)
	patches/less-38*-SuSE*-select.patch (only the corresponding file
		without directory name)
	README.less-select (which is a copy of README).
Copy less-select.tar.gz into /usr/src/packages/SOURCES and
copy SuSE/less-select-*.spec into /usr/src/packages/SPECS
(where * has to replaced by the appropriate version number)
Then execute
	rpmbuild -bb --clean less-select-*.spec
This will generate the binary package in the appropriate subdirectory in
/usr/src/packages/RPMS which you can install with rpm -U.
(You can remove the content of the source tree /usr/src/packages/BUILD
after compilation or by specifying corresponding options in rpmbuild).
