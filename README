(it should be used with the less program without changing the license).

This is a patch to provide selection support for the "less" program.

It allows to select files (or other content) interactively from a list,
using the less program. A perl script making use of this feature and
executing certain commands on the selected files is also provided.

To see what the perl script does, run it with the --man option
(this option should also work if you have not yet installed the patched
version of less program).

Compatibility problems with this patch should hardly occur:
If the new option (-Y) of the less program is not used,
less will behave exactly as without the patch.

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
